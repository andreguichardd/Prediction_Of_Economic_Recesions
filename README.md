# Prediction_Of_Economic_Recessions

Overview
This thesis examines the causes, impacts, and recovery patterns associated with economic recessions in the United States, with a particular focus on the most recent downturns. It analyzes historical data, economic indicators, and policy responses to identify patterns and contributing factors that precede recessions and influence recovery.
